error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/amans0m/Devops-project.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind

hint: use 'git pull' before pushing again.

Follow these steps to fix the issue:

Pull the latest changes from the remote main branch: This will update your local branch with any new commits that have been added remotely.

bash
Copy code

git pull origin main --rebase


This command ensures that your changes will be applied on top of the existing remote changes.

Resolve any merge conflicts (if they arise): If there are merge conflicts, Git will show you the conflicting files. You need to manually resolve these conflicts, then mark them as resolved:

bash
Copy code

git add .

After resolving the conflicts, you can continue with the rebase process by running:

bash
Copy code


git rebase --continue

Push your changes to the main branch: After the rebase is done, push the changes:

bash
Copy code

git push -u origin main
